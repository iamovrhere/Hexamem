Hexamem Game
======
This project is intended to be a coding challenge by setting out a set of somewhat, stringent rules, and still create a functional game.

The Challenge
------

The primary goal of this project is to create a "Simon Says" style of game using only CSS2/CSS3 & HTML for the visuals. No images, either vector or bitmap (png/SVGs), are allowed for the primary visuals. Despite this, the game has to retain a degree of visual appeal (not composed purely of squares).

Additionally the game must provide cross-browser support, not only for Firefox, Chrome & iOS 7 (Safari iPad), but should include limited support for IE8 by means of progressive enhancement/graceful degradation.

Lastly, it must be done without the use of external libraries.

###Compatibility & Demo
As the project is incomplete, compatibility is currently limited to: 
- Firefox 16
- Chrome 26
- iPad (iOS 7)
