Challenge

Goals:
-------

To create a "simon says" style game using only css + html for the visuals.

-Must be visually pleasing and NOT use squares
-Must show the current round
-Must show the maximum round
-Must have basic support for IE8 (by means of progressive enhancement)
-Must have support for Firefox, Chrome & iOS 7 Safari iPad
-Must avoid external libraries

-Audio is optional.
-Score storage is optional.

******** Most importantly: To create it quickly. ******** 
The clock starts when this file is committed (only a blank index.html exists).


Notes
-------


Original thoughts are to use hexagons for the "lights".
Thought: Does IE8 support pseudo-css-elements?  I think not.
Thought: Does IE8 support rotation? I think not.

Have an auto progress on the start (checkbox to make it optional)

Use css3 animations for the flashes

In IE8 use a combination of timeouts & opacity to do the flashes.
